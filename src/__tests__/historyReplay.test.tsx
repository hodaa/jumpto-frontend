/**
 * Replaying a saved search, end to end.
 *
 * The point of this file is the seam between two pages: the history page knows
 * when a keyword was found, and the home view owns the player. Nothing else
 * proves that clicking a keyword on one actually puts the video on screen at the
 * right second on the other — the two halves can each be correct while the
 * handoff between them is wrong, and the symptom (a link that goes nowhere
 * useful) is exactly what a user notices first.
 *
 * A shared-moment link and a history click are the same journey, so this also
 * pins that they end in the same place: arriving at `?v=…&t=…` on a cold load
 * and clicking a keyword from `#/history` must be indistinguishable to App.
